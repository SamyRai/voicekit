# VoiceKit Foundation Sprint Todo

## ASR streaming correctness sprint (2026-09, COMPLETE — v0.4.0)

- [x] Feed caller chunks to Sherpa exactly once; remove rolling-window replay and
  long-chunk truncation from the native online path.
- [x] Make `FinishStream` flush with `InputFinished` without resubmitting audio.
- [x] Report cumulative per-utterance online duration instead of chunk-local duration.
- [x] Give every streaming session its own VAD detector and close it on finalization,
  removal, timeout, and service shutdown.
- [x] Preserve bounded VAD pre-roll until speech activation; retire unlinked
  sessions and discard native state before terminal errors return capacity.
- [x] Make streaming-manager/service shutdown idempotent and reject sessions after close.
- [x] Enforce `MaxConcurrentStreams` with a typed capacity error and deterministic
  admission tests.
- [x] Replace token-as-word result mapping with an explicit token contract and only
  expose word timing after real word segmentation.
- [x] Reconcile README, ASR examples, meeting guide, research note, roadmap, and
  sprint status with the implemented v0.4.0 contracts and current repository truth.
- [x] Pass `make verify`, model-matrix dry-run, `govulncheck`, API-diff validation,
  and the downstream `asr_server` suite against the local checkout.

## Engine Sprint (2026-07, COMPLETE) — streaming completeness & capability exposure

Theme: close the streaming lifecycle, expose high-value sherpa capabilities the
`sherpa-onnx-go` v1.13.4 binding already provides, and pay down validation/DX
debt surfaced by the first real downstream integration (asr_server). Rationale,
findings, and the confirmed-wrappable-vs-not audit are in `PRODUCT_ROADMAP_2026.md`
(Engine Track). Breaking interface changes are permitted.

P0 — streaming lifecycle + validation
- [x] Public `FinishStream(ctx, sessionID)` on `types.ASRService` + `asr.Service`;
  real `SherpaOnlineModel.FinishAudio` (`InputFinished` + flush-decode) with a
  hermetic + env-gated test proving a non-empty final. (Unblocks asr_server's
  online finalization + WER.)
- [x] `make fetch-test-models` (digest-pinned off `testdata/model_matrix.yaml`) +
  env-gated native smoke across ASR/VAD/TTS/diarization/speaker; wire into CI.
  (Supersedes the "make fetch-test-models" stretch item below.)
- [x] Provider-name validation/aliasing (VAD/TTS/ASR) — reject or normalize
  unknown providers loudly (fixes the `silero` vs `silero_vad` silent-nil
  footgun); validate multilingual-Kokoro `lang`/`lexicon` before synthesis.

P1 — capability exposure (confirmed present in the sherpa-onnx-go v1.13.4 binding)
- [x] Streaming TTS `StreamingSynthesizer` over the `GeneratedAudio` per-chunk
  callback (chunked, interruptible via context).
- [x] Punctuation restoration wrapper (`Online`/`OfflinePunctuation`) as a
  post-ASR normalizer.
- [x] Keyword spotting wrapper (`KeywordSpotter`) for streaming wake-word/hotword.
- [x] Spoken language identification wrapper (`SpokenLanguageIdentification`) for
  auto language routing.

P2 — engine hardening
- [x] Speech denoiser preprocessing stage (offline GTCRN/DPDFNet + online
  streaming; `denoise` package, optional stage in the full pipeline).
- [x] Multi-online-model hosting: `OnlineModels` + per-session language routing
  (`SetSessionLanguage`), sticky per-session model binding.
- [x] Recognizer pooling/warmup decision kept evidence-gated: env-gated
  init/first-chunk benchmarks shipped (`make bench-asr-init`); no pool was added
  without real-model numbers.
- [x] `evaluation` DER metric; speaker DB retention/eviction (LRU/FIFO + TTL,
  broadened triggers, root-config wiring).

Not a simple wrap (needs `sherpa-onnx-go` binding work — Go exposes only
cpu/cuda/coreml): QNN/RKNN/Ascend NPU providers — deferred, not in this sprint.

## Hardening & currency sprint (July 2026)

- [x] Remove inert metrics snapshot pool; clarify energy-VAD mean-square; iterative union-find.
- [x] Hermetic config field-mapping tests for all ASR, TTS, VAD, and diarization families.
- [x] Upgrade sherpa-onnx-go v1.13.3 -> v1.13.4 (ONNX Runtime 1.27).

- [x] Recommended model matrix (`testdata/model_matrix.yaml`, Nemotron streaming default).
- [x] Decode FLAC/MP3/Ogg-Vorbis via pure-Go libraries (AAC/M4A remain unsupported).
- [x] Race regression for concurrent online ASR process vs close.
- [x] `make fetch-test-models` + broader env-gated native smoke (tooling shipped in
  the Engine Sprint P0; matrix URL/digest pinning remains a data task).
- [x] Speaker DB retention/eviction and measured performance pass.
